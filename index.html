        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            During 48 years, the managing committee, the principals and the staff of S.P.N. College contributed a lot to the expansion and progress of this institution. In the beginning, the college had five classrooms and the student strength was less than four
            hundred. But the college continued making tremendous progress every year. The present number of 80 classrooms, an administration block, Commerce Block, a big separate library building, a big student centre, a bank branch, ATMs, Science block
            with state of Art Laboratories, computer centre, parents’ cum visitors’ room, management conference room and fully equipped laboratories have given the college a new shape now. As a result of the combined efforts, the number of students in
            the college is more than 1500, which is a rare achievement of our institution.
